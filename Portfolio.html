                    Angiosperms are the dominant form of plant life in most terrestrial ecosystems, comprising about 90
                    percent of all plant species. Most crops and ornamental plants are angiosperms. Their success comes
                    from two innovative structures that protect reproduction from variability in the environment: the flower
                    and the fruit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flowers were derived from modified leaves. The main parts of a flower are the sepals and
                    petals, which protect the reproductive parts: the stamens and the carpels. The stamens produce the male
                    gametes in pollen grains. The carpels contain the female gametes (the eggs inside the ovules), which are
                    within the ovary of a carpel. The walls of the ovary thicken after fertilization, ripening into fruit that
                    ensures dispersal by wind, water, or animals.

                    The angiosperm life cycle is dominated by the sporophyte stage. Double fertilization is an event unique
                    to angiosperms. One sperm in the pollen fertilizes the egg, forming a diploid zygote, while the other
                    combines with the two polar nuclei, forming a triploid cell that develops into a food storage tissue
                    called the endosperm.
